# Recipe Book App

## Overview

This project aims to create a central, mobile-friendly site that serves as a long-term, reliable digital recipe book. Unlike cloud-dependent services that may change or become unavailable, this self-hosted application ensures recipe data is always accessible and secure.

## Features

### Recipe Management

- **Save** food recipes from various sources.
- **Store** recipe data locally to safeguard against paywalls or website shutdowns.
- **Import** recipes by scraping certain webpages, including:
  - 📌 URL
  - 🥕 Ingredients
  - 📖 Instructions
  - 📝 Notes
  - ⏳ Prep/cooking times
  - 🍽️ Serving count
  - 🔗 Related data
- **Manage** recipe collections (e.g., `breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, `snacks`).

### Search & Ingredient Management

- 🔍 **Search** recipes by ingredient.
- 🔄 **Support synonyms** for ingredients to improve search accuracy (e.g., searching for `green onion`, `spring onion`, or `scallion` returns the same results).
- 📌 **Store recent searches** for quick lookup of historical searches.
- 😎 **AI-powered** ingredient recognition and suggestion system

### Meal Planning

- 📅 **Add recipes to a "Plan"** for meals to be cooked soon.
- 🛒 **Identify saved recipes** using specific ingredients to minimize food waste.

### Data Export

- 📄 **Export** individual recipes or the entire cookbook as PDFs for easy printing.
