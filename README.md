# MyRecipeSite

**The Problem**
Create a central mobile-friendly site that provides the ability to store recipes from various sources and can be relied upon as a recipe book that can be used for years to come. It should not be reliant on a cloud service that is subject to change. search by ingredient. 
When there are ingredients in the house that need to be used before going bad, there is no quick way to find which saved recipes use the ingredient.  
Store recipe ingredients and instructions text locally to protect against the source website from switching to monitized system, requiring a subscriptions or goes down and is no longer available.
Be able to export recipes to PDF for easy printing.

**The Plan**
Use Flask to get experience with Python. Use seperate servers for the app and database.
